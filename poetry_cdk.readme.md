# AWS CDK Poetry Project

Welcome to the **AWS CDK Poetry Project**! This project template provides a streamlined setup for creating AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) projects managed with Python Poetry. This README will guide you through various aspects of the project, including adding libraries/modules, bootstrapping the CDK environment, and running other CDK commands.

## Introduction

The **AWS CDK Poetry Project** simplifies the process of creating AWS CDK projects by integrating them with Python Poetry for dependency management. This allows you to easily define and deploy cloud infrastructure using familiar tools and best practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.7+)
- Node.js (14.x or later)
- AWS CDK CLI (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- Poetry (`pip install poetry`)

### Installation

Clone the **AWS CDK Poetry** project repository:

Navigate to the project directory:

Install project dependencies using Poetry:

## Project Structure

The project directory structure is designed to keep your AWS CDK project organized and integrated with Poetry:

```
<project-name>/
├── src/
│   └── <project-name>/
│       ├── app.py
│    	├──<project-name>/
│    	│  ├── __init__.py/
│    	│  └── <project-name>_stack.py/
│       └── <tests>/
│    	   ├── __init__.py/
│    	   └── <unit>/
│    		  ├── __init__.py/
│    		  └── test_<project-name>_stack.py/
├── .gitignore
├── poetry.lock
└── pyproject.toml
```

The `src/` directory contains the AWS CDK project files, while `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` are the Poetry configuration files.

- `src/`: Contains AWS CDK project files.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- `poetry.lock`: Lock file generated by Poetry to ensure consistent dependencies.
- `pyproject.toml`: Poetry configuration file.

## Adding Libraries/Modules

To add libraries or modules to your project, use the following steps:

Open a terminal in your project directory.

Run the following command to add the desired library:

```
poetry add <library-name>
```

```
poetry install
```

The library will be added to your `pyproject.toml` file, and the `poetry.lock` file will be updated.

## Bootstrapping the CDK

Before deploying CDK resources, you need to bootstrap the CDK environment. Run the following command:

```
cdk bootstrap
```

This ensures that your AWS account is set up to manage CDK resources.

## Running CDK Commands

To deploy your CDK resources, use the following command:

```
cdk deploy
```

This command will deploy the AWS resources defined in your CDK stacks.

To destroy your CDK resources, use the following command:

```
cdk destroy
```

This command will remove all the resources defined in your CDK stacks.
